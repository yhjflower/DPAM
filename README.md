# DPAM
A pytorch implementation of "Dynamic Points Agglomeration for Hierarchical Point Sets Learning" (DPAM) (ICCV2019)

Only the Point Cloud Classification part is available in this version, and the Parameter Sharing Scheme in Section 3.4 and T-Net in Section 4.1 are not yet implemented. 

According to Table 4 and Table 5, the accuracy should be about 90% on ModelNet40. However, our implementation reaches only 86.4% classification accuracy on ModelNet40. We hope to discuss with everyone interested in this project.
